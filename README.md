# Hotel_Booking_support

the technical development and progress of an AI-powered chatbot system designed to provide hotel and flight booking support. The primary goal of the project is to simulate a virtual travel assistant capable of understanding user inputs, offering relevant travel suggestions, and delivering conversational responses. The system integrates frontend and backend components using technologies such as Rasa (a Python-based chatbot framework), Flask (a Python web server), and standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to build a fully functional interface.
The report begins with an introduction to chatbot systems and their relevance in the travel industry. The objective section outlines core features such as destination selection, budget filtering, date selection, predefined buttons, and voice input, all aimed at enhancing user interaction. The methodology details the step-by-step development process â€” from requirement analysis and dataset collection to backend logic, chatbot training, and full interface integration.
Key technologies include Rasa for chatbot development, Pandas for manipulating CSV travel datasets, Flask for backend API management, and SQLite3 for efficient local data storage. The results so far include a responsive login/signup interface, a functional chatbot UI, structured datasets, and trained intent-based responses. The project is currently in the integration and testing phase.
The conclusion summarizes the work achieved and emphasizes the practical relevance of building such a travel assistant. Future scope includes integrating live booking APIs, expanding to trains and buses, creating personalized user profiles, and deploying the system publicly. Overall, the project highlights valuable skills in AI, full-stack development, and NLP.
